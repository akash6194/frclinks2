## Overview
============
FRCLinks takes the pain out of navigating the FIRST website. It lets you use short and memorable URLs which
redirect to the appropriate pages on [firstinspires.org](http://firstinspires.org).

For example, to find the page listing Team 254's information and past events and awards, don't visit
the FIRST website and have to click through several pages and menus; instead, just point your browser to
[frc.link/t/254](http://frc.link/t/254). Similarly, if you want to visit Team 296's website but don't
know the address, just go to [frc.link/w/296](http://frc.link/w/296).

For the full list of available shortcuts, see the [frc.link](http://frc.link) homepage.

## Implementation Details
==========================
FRCLinks is written in Ruby using the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) framework, and runs on an Amazon EC2
instance.
